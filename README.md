Deals Tracker is a web application to track successful deals by a fictitious insurance company.
It can be used by sales executives to record their deals and track the premium and target.

### Features:
- A new user has to register themselves by creating a unique username that should be 4-8 characters long, a password, and confirm it.
- An existing user can just log in into the app by entering their username and password.
- After successful login users will be directed to the profile page where they can view their username and a button to log out from the application.

The app contains four tabs. They are Add Deal, Track, Progress, and Profile.

#### Add Deal:
In this tab, the user is presented with a simple form to record a new deal. They have to select the product from the dropdown list, enter the premium amount and application id which will be helpful to further track that policy in company CMS, and submit the form to create the record.

#### Track:

This page is divided into two sections:

- At the top user can see some statistics to track their achievement. The user can view the premium collected for that particular day, the total premium collected till now, their target, and lag amount to hit the target.
- The bottom section lists detailed information about each deal. It shows the name of the product, application id, and the premium amount for each deal for the selected date.
- A user can tap or click the back button available in the App bar to go back to the track page.
